# My Portfolio

Welcome to the repository of my personal portfolio. This project has been a journey of learning, implementing, and refining. I'm excited to share the features I've built and the lessons I've learned along the way.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using a variety of modern web development technologies, including:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- SCSS: A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS.
- And more...

## Features

### Dark Mode

One of the features I'm most proud of is the implementation of a dark mode theme. Not only does this feature provide a visually appealing alternative to the default light theme, but it also respects user preferences. The theme preference is saved in local storage, so returning users will see their chosen theme. If no preference is saved, the site will default to the theme set by the user's system.

### Resume Download

Visitors to my portfolio can download my resume directly from the site. This feature provides a convenient way for potential employers or collaborators to learn more about my qualifications and experience.

### Contact Form

I've implemented a contact form to make it easy for visitors to reach out to me. Whether you have a question, a comment, or a job offer, I'd love to hear from you!

### Dynamic Project Loading

The projects displayed on my portfolio are loaded dynamically from GitHub. This means that as I continue to work on new projects and push my code to GitHub, my portfolio will automatically stay up-to-date with my latest work.

## What I Learned

Building this portfolio has been a great opportunity for me to refine my skills and learn new techniques. Implementing features like dark mode and dynamic project loading required me to think critically about user experience and data management. I also learned about new technologies and tools, and how to integrate them into my workflow.

I'm proud of what I've built, and I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer. Thanks for visiting my portfolio, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or comments!
